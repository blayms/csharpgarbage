# 🗑️ C# Garbage – A Collection of Random C# Code
<sub><sup>All of that was obviously written by ChatGPT, but it's like 40% correct, maybe...</sup></sub><br/>
Welcome to **C# Garbage**, a chaotic repository filled with random C# scripts, experiments, and maybe even full projects!  
This is not a structured library, nor is it meant to be a "serious" codebase. Instead, it’s basically a trash bin that contains various C# files written by [Blayms](https://blayms.github.io/about-me/).  

Some of it might be useful. Some of it might be completely pointless.  
Most of it? Well... let’s just say...

## 📌 What's Inside?

This repo contains a variety of C# snippets, ranging from small utilities to weird experiments??? Some files might be polished, others could be poorly optimized.

### 🚀 **Standalone Scripts**
These are self-contained C# scripts that may do something useful—or at least interesting.  
You might find:
- **Math & Utility Functions** – Because why not reinvent the wheel?  
- **Console Applications** – Small scripts doing random tasks.  
- **Automation Tools** – Who doesn’t love automating boring stuff?
- **Testing or additions to different tools** – Because why not?

### 🎮 **Game Development Code**
As a developer working with C# (including Unity), there’s bound to be some game-related code lying around.  
Some examples:
- **Unity Scripts** – Components, helpers, or game mechanics that may or may not work.  
- **Silk.NET & OpenGL Stuff** – Graphics programming experiments.  
- **Random Prototypes** – Concepts for games that never saw the light of day.  

### 🔬 **Experimental & Weird Code**
Sometimes, an idea pops up that **must** be coded, even if it makes no sense.  
Here you’ll find:
- **Abuse of C# Features** – Reflection, unsafe code, and other madness.  
- **Metaprogramming Experiments** – Code that writes code. Because why not?  
- **Performance Benchmarks** – What happens if you try *this*?  

### 💀 **Abandoned & Unfinished Projects**
Not everything reaches completion, but that doesn’t mean the code is useless.  
This section includes:
- **Half-Built Apps** – Maybe you can salvage something from them.  
- **Broken Prototypes** – They tried, they failed, they live here now.  
- **Concepts Without Purpose** – Interesting but directionless ideas.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  

This repo is a **wild** mix of code. Some of it is well-written, but a lot of it is unpolished, experimental, or just plain bad.  

If you decide to use anything from here, at least put me in credits I dunno. No guarantees of code functionality.
